Operating System : 
___________________

An operating system is a software package, that which acts as an interface between user and application programs. 

There are 2 types of operating systems known as

1) Single User

	DOS

	WINDOWS

2) Multi User 


	UNIX

UNIX is an operating system, that which produces more security features. 

Unix Architecture has a layered architecture, with 2 components

	1) KERNAL

		Kernal is heart w.r.t. Unix env, which takes care of 

		-> Process Management

		-> Memory Management

		-> File Management

		-> Service Management 

	In bootstraping process, the kernal loaded into memory and initiates
	various other processes for users to effictively make use of unix OS. 

	2) System Programs 

	Shell : Shell acts as an interface between the user and UNIX OS. 

	This is called command interpreter, which used to interpret statements. 

1) pwd -> Print Working Directory (Present Working Directory) 

2) cd -> Returns to the default directory. 

3) ls -> Used to see the list of files

4) ls -l -> Used to display long listing of files. 

5) mkdir -> used to make a directory 

   mkdir <directory_name> 

   mkdir tb15

6) cd directory_name :  To change to particular directory 

   cd tb15   

7) touch file_name : Creates an empty file

8) cat > fileName : Used to create a new file. 

after typing to save the file press <ctrl+d>

9) cat file_name : Displays the contents of the file. 

10) mv old_name new_name : Used to rename old file with new file_name 

11) rm file_name : used to remove the file.

12) rmdir directory_name : used to remove the directory

13) cp location1 location2 : used to copy file from one location to another

Pipes and filters
__________________

wc : Used to display no.of words/lines/characters from a file. 

wc fileName : Display lines/words/chars of a file. 

wc -c fileName : displays only characters

wc -w filename : displays only words

wc -l filename : displays only lines 


15) head : Displays no.of lines from top 

	head -5 filename : Displays first 5 lines of the file

16) tail : Displays no.of lines from last

tail -5 filename : displays last 5 lines of the file

17) sort : used to sort the given file data 

sort file_name : sorts the file content in ascending order

sort -r file_name : sorts the file content in descending order

< for input any file 

> for redirect output to any file specified 


18) grep (Globally search for regular Expression and PrintOut) 

    grep "training" training.txt -> Displays all lines where the word training exists

    grep -c "training" training.txt -> Displays count, no.of times the word training exists 

    grep -n "training" training.txt -> Displays all lines where the word training exists including line nos


19) tr : Used to translate from one foramt to another (mostly casing and delimters we can use) 

 tr "," "  " < info.txt > res3.txt

 tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" < res1.txt > upper.txt

What is Version Control System :
__________________________________

Version Control system is a system, that records changes of single file or set of files. 

When multiple people are working in same project, then lot of changes will happen on multiple files simultaneousy, as we need to keep track of all those things, can be maintained by using Version Control System. 

To implement such kind of things, we have git 

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system deigned to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Every Git working directroy contains a full fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities. 

It will not dependent on network access or central server. 

There are 3 main stages we have in git as 

1) Working Directory

	Single checkoiut of one version of the project (current repository folder we call as working directory)

2) Staging Area

	It is a simpel file, generally present in git directory, that stores information about the next commit. 

	Whichever files, we need to upload or update in git, we need to add to the staging area. 

3) Git Directory 

	Stores the metata and object database for the project (contains all remote files for which repository is having permissions to upload and access) 

Git Life Cycle : 
________________

There are 4 stages we have in GIT as 

1) Working Directory

   THis is the default repository folder with branch name.

2) Staging Area

	To add the files to the staging area 

	git add filename (or) 
	
        if you want to add all the files to the staging area, then 

	git add .


3) Local Repository

	To add the files to the local repository 

	git commit -m "unix/git notes"


4) Remote Repository 

	To upload the file(s) to remote repository, then 

	git push origin branch_name 

3) Git Directory
